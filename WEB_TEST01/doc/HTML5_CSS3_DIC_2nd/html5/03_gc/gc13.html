<p>The <code>div</code> element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the <code>class</code>, <code>lang</code>, and <code>title</code> attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements.</p>
<p>Authors are strongly encouraged to view the <code>div</code> element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of the <code>div</code> element instead of more appropriate elements leads to poor accessibility for readers and poor maintainability for authors.</p>
